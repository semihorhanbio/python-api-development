# Learn Python API development

I will build a full-fledged API in Python using FastAPI. I will try to implement simple social-media app backend which users can carry out CRUD functionalities while learning the fundamentals of API design including routes, serialization/deserialization, schema validation, and models. I will also implement database functionality with PostgreSQL, testing with pytest, and how to build out a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub actions.
